""" Write a Python program that can perform two tasks:



Generate and display the Fibonacci sequence for a given number of terms.
Calculate and display the factorial of a user-provided number.
Input format :
The first line contains a positive integer n which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

The second line contains a non-negative integer m, for which you want to calculate the factorial.

Output format :
If n â‰¤ 0, the output will be: "Please enter a positive integer".

If n > 0, the program will print the Fibonacci sequence up to the n terms, one term per line.



If m < 0, the output will be: "Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers".

If m = 0, the output will be: "The factorial of 0 is 1".

If m > 0, the program will print: "The factorial of [m] is [result]" where the [result] is the calculated factorial.

Sample test cases :"""

    else:
        print("Fibonacci sequence:")
        print(0)
        print(1)
        for _ in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a + b
            print(b)
